## Project Structure

### 1. Introduction
This section provides a foundational understanding of industrial control methods and the significance of accurate system identification in designing effective controllers.

### 2. Problem Definition
The given system is characterized by a first-order denominator with a time delay. The project aims to identify the system using both three- and four-element models and to design various controllers based on these models.

### 3. System Identification
Using MATLAB and Simulink, the system's characteristics are identified:
- **Three-Element Model**: Estimation of parameters such as final value, time constant, and delay.
- **Four-Element Model**: Enhanced modeling through computation-intensive methods and non-linear equation solving.
- **MATLAB `ident` Command**: For further accuracy, identification is performed with and without time delay considerations.

### 4. Response Comparison
All models’ responses are plotted for comparison, with the four-element model generally providing the most accurate behavior.

### 5. System Final State Parameters
Relay feedback is applied to determine the system's final point parameters, using amplitude and oscillation period to extract system details crucial for controller tuning.

### 6. PID Controller Design
PID controllers are designed using different methods:
- **Ziegler-Nichols (Time Domain)**: Provides baseline PID values but may exhibit slow settling time.
- **Ziegler-Nichols (Frequency Domain)**: Improves response speed and overshoot compared to the time domain.
- **Extended Ziegler-Nichols**: Modified tuning for enhanced stability.
- **Lambda Tuning Method**: Based on a predefined λ, optimizing stability and control accuracy.

### 7. Smith Predictor Implementation
The Smith Predictor compensates for system delays, achieving an ideal response by moving the delay out of the feedback loop:
- **Complete System Dynamics**: The Smith Predictor is applied to the original system.
- **Identified Models**: Implemented with each model (three-element, four-element, and `ident`-based) to evaluate model accuracy and stability.

### 8. Analysis and Comparison
The project evaluates various controller designs and their impact on system stability, precision, and response time. The Smith Predictor method, combined with an accurate model, provided optimal delay compensation, resulting in the most stable and responsive control.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining MATLAB’s computational capabilities with robust control design techniques to achieve precise and stable control of time-delay systems in an industrial context.
